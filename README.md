# Sentiment Summarization of Amazon Reviews

Team Members: Jane Zhang, Matthew Bayer, Peter Husisian, Arnav Ghosh, Wes Gurnee

Evaluating potential purchases online is often made easier by reviews provided by other customers. However, sifting through hundreds of reviews to create a holistic view of the sentiment the product evokes can be time-consuming. Consequently, we propose a model that can provide a comprehensive summary of all the reviews on a product. Our task is a specific instantiation of the problem of summarizing the sentiments and opinions of a large group of people into a few key bullet points. That is, given a set of n reviews about a particular product, what are the k most common comments/complaints that are made about this product.

We chose to work on Amazon review data because large amounts of it are easily available. However, the technology would help any website with a large number of reviews or comments distill the information to be much easier to read as a consumer.
